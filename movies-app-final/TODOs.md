Add dependencies here and generate the project.

Unless you want the sequence diagram or something, just use terminal.

But IDE is good for debugging.. :(

This way you have less surprises in CI

I just imported final and clicked apply for downloading gradle*-all.zip

Then open terminal from with in IDE and execute from command line only.

./gradlew clean build jar

hmm..at first it was all errors and i restarted then it all went away.

Ignore the red highlighting error that appears for now, as long as it builds in command line.
